This is a fork of einmalfel's fantastic minimalistic podcast manager. The original can be found at [einmalfel/PodListen](https://github.com/einmalfel/PodListen).

### App idea

Android podcast app with simplified navigation and lightweight interface. It's intended to be convenient even if used on the run.

### Translation

PodListen is ready for translation. If you are willing to contribute by translating the app to your language just make a pull-request with new or updated res/values-XX/strings.xml file.

Alternatively, you can simply [download latest strings.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shanemd/PodListen/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml), translate it, and email it to me.

Currently, PodListen has Croatian, English, German, Russian and incomplete French localizations.
